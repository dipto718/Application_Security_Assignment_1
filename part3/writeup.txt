fuzzer1:
The bug that causes the fuzzer1 test case to crash, based upon exploration of the code and the insertion of various print statements, seems to be that num_bytes is set to a negative and a file can't have a negative size. This issue was resolved by adding a test to see if the num_bytes is negative and informing user if this is
the case so that they know that the gift card wasn't properly formatted.

fuzzer2:
The bug that causes the fuzzer2 test case to crash seems to have some connection to what causes fuzzer1 to crash since when testing my code I saw that the resolution to
fuzzer1 also seemed to resolve the segmentation fault that was occuring here. Therefore, it is very likley that the bug here originated from the num_bytes being set
to some negative number and therefore being invalid for the format of the file.

cov1:
This first coverage test covered the lines responsible for displaying a regular giftcard as that code did not run in the coverage with crash1 and crash2 as both of those were not properly formatted giftcards and hang was an animated messages and not a regular giftcard.

cov2:
This coverage test covered the lines responsible for displaying a messsage since the previous two crashes did not deal with any message attached to the gift card since, as mentioned before,
the test cases for those two crashes were not properly formatted giftcards which is why the user had to be informed of their wrong format.
